## Overview

This React application integrates with the Reqres API to perform basic user management functions such as authentication, user listing, and CRUD operations. The app is divided into three levels of increasing complexity, ensuring a structured and scalable implementation.

### Base API URL

`https://reqres.in/`

## Features

### Level 1: Authentication

- Login screen for user authentication.
- Uses the following endpoint:
  - `POST /api/login` with email and password.
  - Credentials:
    - **Email:** eve.holt@reqres.in
    - **Password:** cityslicka
- On successful login, stores the authentication token in **localStorage** and redirects to the Users List page.

### Level 2: List All Users

- Fetches and displays a paginated list of users.
- Uses the following endpoint:
  - `GET /api/users?page=1`
- Displays user details in a table or card format.
- Implements pagination or lazy loading.

### Level 3: Edit, Delete, and Update Users

- **Edit User:**
  - Clicking 'Edit' opens a form pre-filled with user data.
  - Allows updating first name, last name, and email.
  - Uses endpoint: `PUT /api/users/{id}`
- **Delete User:**
  - Clicking 'Delete' removes the user from the list.
  - Uses endpoint: `DELETE /api/users/{id}`
- Displays success/error messages based on API responses.
